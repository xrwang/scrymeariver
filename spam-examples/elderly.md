Dear Beloved,

I am Daniel Smith and I am a British soldier attached to UN peacekeeping force in Syria. I am the commanding officer of the third Battalion soldier regime. As you may know, everyday there are several cases of insurgent attacks and suicide bombs going on here. We have managed to move funds belonging to some demised persons who were attacked and killed through these attacks.

The total amount is US$196 Million dollars in cash, which we shared among ourselves and I got 3.1 million dollars as my own share of the fund.
Now my mission here in Syria will expire in the middle of next month for me to leave this camp and if I do not ship out the fund; I might end up losing it, because as an army officer, we have no right to take anything from the War zone, nor we are allowed to make calls or to make financial transactions.

I want to move this money to you, so that you can help keep my share for me until when I shall come over to meet you. I will take 70%, while you take 30%. No strings attached! Just to help me move it out of Syria; which is a war zone right now.

I plan on using Diplomatic courier and shipping the money out in a wrapped big envelop, using diplomatic immunity.
If you are interested, I will send you the full details.

Can I trust you for this?

MY Email (ds8185300@gmail.com)

Please signify your interest including your most confidential telephone/fax numbers, home address, city with identity card or passport picture.

Note that this business is risk free.

The wrapped envelop can be placed in a box or briefcase and shipped out to reach you within 72 hours. Please If you are Interested in assisting, kindly reply through this PRIVATE and CONFIDENTIAL Email (ds8185300@gmail.com) for further

PLEASE, TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET.

Respectfully,

Sergeant Daniel Smith
