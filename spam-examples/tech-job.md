Hi Xiaowei,
Hope you’re having a good week! I’m a recruiter for Facebook’s infrastructure and product engineering groups and I wanted to reach out to see if you would be interested in learning more about eng openings in Menlo Park?

We’re working on some very interesting products and we’re scaling fast with over 1.7 billion users worldwide. Our engineering culture is also very open and you would have a chance to work with some smart and humble people.
If interested, feel free to reply via email and we can work on scheduling a time to speak that works for us both :) Looking forward to hear from you either way!
