Hey there,


Many of us spend nearly six hours a day on digital media. You can feel those hours accumulating in your brain; if your screen time isn‚Äôt deliberate, it can lead to stress, anxiety, or cognitive overload.


Take one tech interaction that can cause all three: the number of tabs you have open on your browser. As OneZero columnist Angela Lashbrook writes in her latest edition of Microprocessing, ‚ÄúResearch has found that a browser with so many tabs that you can barely see the favicons is a stressful, productivity-killing time suck.‚Äù One study showed how messy computer screens worsened response times among doctors in emergency rooms and raised their stress levels in what‚Äôs obviously an already stressful environment.


There are many helpful ways to get your tabs under control. Lashbrook recommends programs like OneTab, Pocket, Toby, Evernote, and the Great Suspender to keep things organized. She even has a personal method based around keeping links collated in a single Google Doc for each of her projects. It may seem obsessive, but the mindful effort to deposit the most useful links and information there keeps her from flipping between tabs‚Äîand keeps her focus intact.


Consumer gadgets and apps have become so simple to use that we can forget that these tools also need to be used well. If you‚Äôre one of those people with an unending cascade of tabs in your browser, this brief is for you.


To tomorrow ü§ñ,

By the Numbers


9: Arguably the ideal number of tabs for any given browser window. Holding CTRL or ‚åò and pressing any number key will jump you to that tab number; going higher than 9 effectively locks you out of that helpful shortcut, as Lifehacker once explained.


500: The maximum number of tabs Safari on iOS allows, as of a few months ago, at least.
