I got the boots of my dreams.
Tuesday: â€˜send email about bootsâ€™ (ðŸ‘¢)

See, Iâ€™m someone that forgets everything. Thatâ€™s why I write down every little detail about my work on my monday.com board.

You're reading this email, this task is marked as â€˜doneâ€™ on my board, and as always when I finish something, I showed the email to Roy (my boss, in case you didnâ€™t read yesterdayâ€™s email).

He loved my boots but was more interested in what I wanted to offer anyone who reads this email â€” 30 days free trial instead of 7.

Yes, I added 30 days free trial of monday.com to your account!

So, grab your team, go to your account and try these:
Plan your 2020 projects, high-level and step by step
Use automations to get notified when things are due, stuck or if deadlines are looming
Update and share files on the app instead of sending emails to one another
Organize other processes, from your recruitment plan to next yearâ€™s budget and your office NYE party
And for those who are interested (many asked), hereâ€™s a picture of my fabulous new boots..
